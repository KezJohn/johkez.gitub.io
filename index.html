								<h2><a href="#">My Work
									</a></h2>  
								<p>Several projects have been successfully executed over the past years, including the notable house fire restoration in Frisco, completed in May 2022. 
									This challenging assignment involved coordinating with distressed clients, sourcing suitable vendors, and managing technical aspects such as estimations, 
									product searches, and engineering updates. Beyond merely restoring damaged property, the project required integrating modern features to enhance the home 
									beyond its original state while meeting stringent city requirements.
									Initially, it was challenging to handle the stressed clients and align the project’s various demands.
									 However, by gradually building a positive relationship with the clients, fostering trust, and assuring them that our company’s services were reliable, 
									 I was able to ease their concerns. I helped them see that we could recover their losses with better designs within their budget. 
									 This approach allowed me to focus on other demanding aspects of the project. This experience showde me the necessity of sustaining cooperative and
									  calm client relationships, which helped me to learn that effective CRM strategies greatly enhance project outcomes and reduce the risk of errors.
